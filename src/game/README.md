# little-hell-example-game

This is all the game code, _not_ the engine code, or the dedicated server code. It links against the engine, but other than that the two are decoupled from a build/include/dependency standpoint (as it should be).
It may or may not eventually live in its own repo one day (such as `ranguli/little-hell-example-game`). However, while the current Meson build configuration permits(?) the _engine_ being added and built as a submodule, the game is built by the projects top-level meson.build. We would need to modify the build configuration and deal with project/subprojects and stuff. It might be simpler just to keep the example game inside the example repo. It's supposed to be a living example of the engine, so maybe it should just _live in_ the example repo.

Right now, the "game" itself is a fork of Chocolate Doom that will be modified very heavily to match the new engine APIs. Eventually, a new game IWAD will be created using copyleft assets from the Freedoom project. The game data will live in a separate repository, like `little-hell-example-game-data`. All the code must be GPL, and developers must release their code under the GPL, but developers can copyright their game data. So if we keep it separate, we're setting a good example to avoid the pitfall of someone bundling everything into one repo, and then having issues coming into GPL compliance. That creates friction and friction is bad.
