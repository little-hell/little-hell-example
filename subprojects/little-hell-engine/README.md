# little-hell-engine

This is the engine code! It builds separately from any game code. When games are built they are linked against the engine library. Eventually it will live in its own repository such as https://github.com/ranguli/little-hell-engine, and this example repository will clone the `ranguli/little-hell-engine` as a submodule.
